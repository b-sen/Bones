# Bones

Created for TOJam 2021: Feels Like a Rerun.

## Premise

Something dangerous lurks in the dungeon - so dangerous that no adventurer who entered has ever lived to tell the tale.  To end the needless loss of life, the town above has decreed that no one may enter physically; instead the town provides magically controlled golems by which anyone may try to best the horrors within.  But minimal expense is spared to equip the golems, since every previous challenger has only managed to leave their bones behind...

## Inspiration and Gameplay Mechanics

In NetHack and related hacklike games, when a player character dies, they sometimes leave behind a "bones level" with all their items... and whatever killed them.  This level can appear in later games, presenting an increased challenge along with a very lucrative opportunity to loot the predecessor character.  To run with the jam theme of "Once More With Feeling", I decided to turn this possibility into a core mechanic - players are not meant to defeat the presented enemy on their first character, but by deliberately dying to leave materials and/or terrain behind for future runs.
